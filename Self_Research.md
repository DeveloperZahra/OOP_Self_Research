# 🧠 Difference between data type and data structure

|Data Types|	Data Structures|
|----------|-------------------|
|Data Type is the kind or form of a variable which is being used throughout the program. It defines that the particular variable will assign the values of the given data type only|	Data Structure is the collection of different kinds of data. That entire data can be represented using an object and can be used throughout the entire program.|
|Implementation through Data Types is a form of abstract implementation|	Implementation through Data Structures is called concrete implementation|
|Can hold values and not data, so it is data less|	Can hold different kind and types of data within one single object|
|Values can directly be assigned to the data type variables	|The data is assigned to the data structure object using some set of algorithms and operations like push, pop and so on.|
|No problem of time complexity	| Time complexity comes into play when working with data structures|
|Examples: int, float, double	|Examples: stacks, queues, tree|
