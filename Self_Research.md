# 🧠 Difference between data type and data structure

|Data Types|	Data Structures|
|----------|-------------------|
|Data Type is the kind or form of a variable which is being used throughout the program. It defines that the particular variable will assign the values of the given data type only|	Data Structure is the collection of different kinds of data. That entire data can be represented using an object and can be used throughout the entire program.|
|Implementation through Data Types is a form of abstract implementation|	Implementation through Data Structures is called concrete implementation|
|Can hold values and not data, so it is data less|	Can hold different kind and types of data within one single object|
|Values can directly be assigned to the data type variables	|The data is assigned to the data structure object using some set of algorithms and operations like push, pop and so on.|
|No problem of time complexity	| Time complexity comes into play when working with data structures|

## 📌 Types of Data Type:

There are 5 common data types namely:

✅ Integer: Whole numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3)

✅ Float: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5)

✅ Character: Single characters (e.g., ‘a’, ‘B’)

✅ String: Sequences of characters (e.g., ‘hello’, ‘goodbye’)

✅ Boolean: Logical values (true or false)

## 📌 Types of Data Structure:

Data structures are categorized based on their organization, accessibility, and manipulation of data. They are broadly classified into 2 types:

## 1. Linear Data Structure
A linear data structure is a type of data structure where the elements are arranged sequentially. In a linear structure, each element is connected to its previous and next elements and stored in a single, continuous sequence. This structure allows for easy traversal, insertion, and deletion of elements. The linear data structure is further classified into two types:

⭐ **Static:**  In a linear data structure, a static refers to a data structure with a fixed size and memory allocation at compile time. It can be represented as: 

⭐ **Arrays:**  A collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.

⭐ **Dynamic:** The dynamic refers to a data structure with a variable size and memory allocation at runtime. It can be represented as: 

⭐ **Linked Lists:**  A sequence of nodes, each containing a value and a reference (i.e., a ‘link’) to the next node.

⭐ **Stack:** A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, where elements are added and removed from the top.

⭐ **Queue:**  A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure, where elements are added to the end and removed from the front.

## 2. Non-Linear Data Structure
A non-linear data structure is a type of data structure where the elements are not stored sequentially. It allows for more complex relationships between elements. In these structures, each element can be connected to multiple elements, and there is no single ‘next’ or ‘previous’ element in a simple sequence. The non-linear data structure is classified into two types:

⭐ **Trees:** A hierarchical structure where each node has a finite number of child nodes. It can be represented as:

⭐ **Binary Trees:** There are only two children per node (left and right).

⭐ **Balanced Trees:** Trees that maintain a balance between the height of the left and right subtrees.

⭐ **AVL Trees:** A self-balancing binary search tree.

⭐ **B-Trees:** A multi-level index that balances search, insertion, and deletion operations.

⭐ **Heaps:** Tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.

⭐ **Graphs:** A graph is a non-linear collection of nodes connected by edges. It can be represented as:

⭐ **Directed Graphs:** Edges have direction and represent a one-way relationship.

⭐ **Undirected Graphs:** Edges are bidirectional and represent a two-way relationship.



## 📌 When to Use Data Types vs Data Structures:

Understanding when to use data types and data structures is key for managing efficient and optimized code.

⭐ Data types are ideal when you are dealing with simple values like numbers or text. 
For example, if you need to store a user's age, you will use an integer data type.

⭐ Data structures are required to store or manipulate multiple values efficiently. 
For example, if you need to keep track of a list of students, a data structure like an array or linked list would be more suitable.

# 🧠 Introduction of Object Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use 
objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement
real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming.
The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions
that operate on them so that no other part
of the code can access this data except that function.

## 📌 OOPs Concepts

## 📌 Why do we need object-oriented programming:

⭐ To make the development and maintenance of projects more effortless. 

⭐ To provide the feature of data hiding that is good for security concerns. 

⭐ We can solve real-world problems if we are using object-oriented programming. 

⭐It ensures code reusability. 

⭐It lets us write generic code: which will work with a range of data, so we don't have to write basic stuff over and over again.
