# 🧠 Difference between data type and data structure

|Data Types|	Data Structures|
|----------|-------------------|
|Data Type is the kind or form of a variable which is being used throughout the program. It defines that the particular variable will assign the values of the given data type only|	Data Structure is the collection of different kinds of data. That entire data can be represented using an object and can be used throughout the entire program.|
|Implementation through Data Types is a form of abstract implementation|	Implementation through Data Structures is called concrete implementation|
|Can hold values and not data, so it is data less|	Can hold different kind and types of data within one single object|
|Values can directly be assigned to the data type variables	|The data is assigned to the data structure object using some set of algorithms and operations like push, pop and so on.|
|No problem of time complexity	| Time complexity comes into play when working with data structures|

## 📌 Types of Data Type:

There are 5 common data types namely:

✅ Integer: Whole numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3)

✅ Float: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5)

✅ Character: Single characters (e.g., ‘a’, ‘B’)

✅ String: Sequences of characters (e.g., ‘hello’, ‘goodbye’)

✅ Boolean: Logical values (true or false)

📌 Types of Data Structure:

Data structures are categorized based on their organization, accessibility, and manipulation of data. They are broadly classified into 2 types:

## 1. Linear Data Structure
A linear data structure is a type of data structure where the elements are arranged sequentially. In a linear structure, each element is connected to its previous and next elements and stored in a single, continuous sequence. This structure allows for easy traversal, insertion, and deletion of elements. The linear data structure is further classified into two types:

⭐ **Static:**  In a linear data structure, a static refers to a data structure with a fixed size and memory allocation at compile time. It can be represented as: 

⭐ **Arrays:**  A collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.

⭐ **Dynamic:** The dynamic refers to a data structure with a variable size and memory allocation at runtime. It can be represented as: 

⭐ **Linked Lists:**  A sequence of nodes, each containing a value and a reference (i.e., a ‘link’) to the next node.

⭐ **Stack:** A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, where elements are added and removed from the top.

⭐ **Queue:**  A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure, where elements are added to the end and removed from the front.
